    "Visualization tools like Voyager and Raw Graphs are great for \"Thinking Visually\" and prototyping. When visualizing data it often is important to work with a programming language because data often needs steps to be taken before visualizing that are easy to apply in a programmatic fashion. The visualization capabilities of a language are also much greater than an individual web tool can provide. Let's get started using python for plotting some of our data.\n",
